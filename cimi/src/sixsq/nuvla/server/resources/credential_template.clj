(ns sixsq.nuvla.server.resources.credential-template
  "
A collection of templates that are used to create a variety of credentials.

**NOTE**: CredentialTemplate resources are in-memory resources and
consequently do **not** support the CIMI filtering parameters.

SlipStream must manage a variety of credentials to provide, for example,
programmatic access to SlipStream or SSH access to virtual machines running on
a cloud infrastructure. The CredentialTemplate resources correspond to the
various methods that can be used to create these resources.

The parameters required can be found within each template, using the standard
CIMI read pattern. Details for each parameter can be found by invoking looking
at the ResourceMetadata resource for the type.

Template | Credential | Description
-------- | ---------- | -----------
import-ssh-public-key | ssh-public-key | imports an SSH public key from an existing key pair
generate-ssh-key-pair | ssh-public-key | generates a new SSH key pair, storing public key and returning private key
generate-api-key | api-key | generates API key and secret, storing secret digest and returning secret
cloud* | cloud-cred-* | credentials specific to particular cloud infrastructures

Typically, there will also be Credential Template resources that describe the
credentials for each supported cloud infrastructure.

```shell
# List all of the credential creation mechanisms
# NOTE: You must be authenticated.  Add the appropriate
# cookie options to the curl command.
