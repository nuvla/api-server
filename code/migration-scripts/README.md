# Migration scripts

## How to run the scripts

The scripts code for the Nuvla migration scripts is contained in the namespaces `com/sixsq/nuvla/migration/script/*`.
They can be run via the REPL by adding the `:migration` profile. Typically each script
has a comment section at the end with the commands to be executed to run the script.
