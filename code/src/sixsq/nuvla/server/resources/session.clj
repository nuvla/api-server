Users (clients) authenticate with the SlipStream server by referencing a
SessionTemplate resource (to identify the authentication method), providing
values for the associated parameters, and then creating a Session resource via
the CIMI 'add' pattern.

A successful authentication attempt will return a token
(as an HTTP cookie) that must be used in subsequent interactions with the
SlipStream server.

The detailed process consists of the following steps:

1. Browse the SessionTemplate resources to find the authentication method that
   you want to use. Unless you have a browser-based client, you will probably
   want to use either 'internal' (username and password) or 'api-key' (API key
   and secret). **Use of API keys and secrets is preferred over the username
   and password.**

2. Prepare a 'create' JSON document that references the SessionTemplate you
   have chosen and provides the corresponding parameters (e.g. username and
   password for 'internal').

3. Post the 'create' document to the Session collection URL. The correct URL
   can be determined from the CEP information.

4. On a successful authentication request, a token will be returned allowing
   access to the SlipStream resources as the authenticated user. **For
   convenience, this token is returned as an HTTP cookie.**

The authentication token (cookie) must be used in all subsequent requests to
the SlipStream server. The token (cookie) has a **limited lifetime** and you
must re-authenticate with the server when the token expires.

> NOTE: To facilitate use of the API from browsers (i.e. javascript), the
session resources also support request bodies with a media type of
'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. When using this media type, encode only
the value of the 'template key in the example JSON forms.

> NOTE: The search feature of Session resources will only return the Session
resource associated with your current session (or none at all if your are not
authenticated). This can be used to determine whether or not you have an active
session.

An example document (named `create-internal.json` below) for authenticating
via the 'interna' (username and password) method.

```json
{
  \"template\" : {
                        \"href\" : \"session-template/internal\",
                        \"username\" : \"your-username\",
                        \"password\" : \"your-password\"
                      }
}
```

A similar document for logging into with an API key/secret (named
`create-api-key.json`). Verify the name of the template on the server; the
administrator may have chosen a different name.

```json
{
  \"template\" : {
                        \"href\" : \"session-template/api-key\",
                        \"key\" : \"your-api-key\",
                        \"secret\" : \"your-api-secret\"
                      }
}
```

```shell
# Be sure to get the URL from the cloud entry point!
# The cookie options allow for automatic management of the
# SlipStream authentication token (cookie).
curl https://nuv.la/api/session \\
     -X POST \\
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
     -d @create-internal.json \\
     --cookie-jar ~/cookies -b ~/cookies -sS
```

On a successful authentication, the above command will return a 201 (created)
status, a 'set-cookie' header, and a 'location' header with the created
session.
